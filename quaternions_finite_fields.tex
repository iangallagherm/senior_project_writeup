    We present and prove a count of the maximal commutative sub-algebras of
    $M_2(\bF_q)$, as well as counts for the individual isomorphism classes.

\section{Introduction}
For a finite field of $q = p^m$ elements, it is possible to count the number of
vector subspaces of ${\bF_q}^n$ of a given dimension. These counts arise in
problems involving the number of points of $\bP^n_q$, the Grassmannian,
and further generalizations. % Might want citations here

This paper is meant to address a similar problem. Namely, the structure and 
count of the maximal commutative sub-algebras of $M_2(\bF_q)$. Such
sub-algebra's...
